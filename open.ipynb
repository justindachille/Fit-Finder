All because the industry hasn’t given this huge cohort of people a second’s thought, and isn’t set up to price them properly.\\nWe saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we’ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.\\nWe know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren’t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there’s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we’re only just getting started.\\nHow we work\\nWe’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.\\nAnd autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.\\nWe’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our culture handbook or read our blog to find out more.\\nThe Engineering Team\\nOur engineers are at the heart of the solutions. They work on product builds from start to finish, solving lots of challenges to help us build fast and scale up! Our engineers cover a range of skills across frontend, backend, full stack, iOS and Android, and work alongside designers, data scientists, researchers and product managers within our product teams.\\nOur product teams include: the Growth team, the Renewals team and the Claims team (to name a few!). Each team sets its own roadmap, and actively pushes our codebase forward.\\nAbout the Team you’d be joining\\nThe Renewals & Midterm Team is one of Marshmallow’s core business teams focussed on ensuring customers want to stay with Marshmallow for the long term.

We work on a hybrid model which means that once a week teams come into the office for an optional team collaboration day, and the other four days are spent working from home (or hot-desking in the office if that’s your jam!).\\nWe’re proud of the flexibility that we offer our Mojis (check us out on Flexa’s Global Top 100 companies!) and want to promote a positive work/life alignment. A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work for every Moji and team, and we encourage you to have conversations with your line manager and team to understand your work preferences and team needs.\\nThe aim is to ensure that Mojis are able to maximise their potential, build trust with their teams, establish an effective work/life alignment and also meet the needs of our growing business!\\nYour tech kit.

At the end of the day, the work needs to be done but we also need you to balance that with life.\\nYour work environment. Our bright and spacious offices offer lots of natural light, a jungle of plants, and different spaces to relax and focus on what you need to do.\\nFood and drink. We stock all the coffee and tea you can drink when in the office and we’re never without snacks!\\nYour budget. You have a monthly wellbeing and lifestyle allowance available through your own personal wallet. Spend it on anything (within reason!) that will help improve your life.\\nYour development. We have found that Mojis who thrive at Vita Mojo embrace a growth mindset and are proactive about their development, find ways to contribute and grow in non-linear (and linear!) ways. We offer a L&D allowance to support you in that development and to gain the skills, knowledge and relationships you need to soar, whether at Vita Mojo or later on in your development journey.\\nYour mental health. Through our partnership with Spill, you can ask a therapist for advice, schedule a one-off therapy session, or use a series of therapy sessions. We also offer Mental Health Days to use in moments when you need to take a day for some additional space to refocus your energies. Personal coaching is available to all Mojis through our partnership with MoreHappi, to help you grow and reach your goals!\\nYour holidays. We believe in finding your work life alignment and want you to take advantage of your 25 days of leave, plus public holidays. Your holiday allowance increases after each complete calendar year of service, up to 28 days.\\nCarer’s Leave. We understand life happens and you may need to take some time to support your loved ones. Whether that be looking after your sick dog, friends or family members. We offer one week (5 days) paid leave to all Mojis.\\nWelcoming a child into your life. We have enhanced Parental leave policies! Parental leave is offered to all Mojis after 3 months at the company. Parental leave is the collective term and includes maternity, paternity, adoption leave and surrogacy. Our leave policy is meant to help you navigate through this time as successfully as possible.\\nWe recognise both the primary caregiver (the person who spends most time with the child) and the secondary (typically this is the non-birthing parent). Primary caregivers receive full pay for the first 16 weeks and 50% pay up to week 32. But need more time off? No problem, you can take up to 52 weeks (statutory) with us!\\nSecondary caregivers receive full pay for the first 4 weeks and an additional 2 weeks after 36 months of continuous service. It's up to you when you start your leave, we are here to support you through the whole process.\\n\\nYour health. We offer 10 days of full pay sick leave.\\nYour birthday. We love celebrating birthdays, whether through baked goods or gifts, and you also get the day off on (or around) your birthday every year.\\nYour social spirit. We love socialising with our fellow Mojis, whether through monthly drinks in the office, quarterly offsite socials (both virtual and in person), celebrating milestones, or anything else that comes up, we enjoy hanging out with each other!\\nDog friendly. We love our furry friends who visit the office! Calling all responsible pet owners to join us!\"},\n",

All because the industry hasn’t given this huge cohort of people a second’s thought, and isn’t set up to price them properly.\\nWe saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we’ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.\\nWe know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren’t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there’s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we’re only just getting started.\\nHow we work\\nWe’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.\\nAnd autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.\\nWe’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our culture handbook or read our blog to find out more.\\nThe Engineering Team\\nOur engineers are at the heart of the solutions.

You’ll be working hand-in-hand with our product and design teams along with our wider technical squads to create, develop and test new features. Our product suite is composed of several mobile apps built with react native and wrapping a web view frontend.\\nThe day-to-day\\nWorking in a startup means that things often change and we adapt to the growing and changing needs of the business. We expect the below to be the majority of the role, but this may change over time depending on your own development needs, aspirations and the makeup of the team.\\nDevelop and maintain mobile applications using Standard Web Technologies alongside React Native.\\nCollaborate in cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features.\\nEnsure the performance, quality, and responsiveness of applications.\\nWork as a strong individual contributor and as part of a mixed skill agile team\\nEnsure that all features are robust, secure, scalable and well documented.\\nWork with hardware integrations like barcode scanners, cameras, printers and payment terminals.\\nParticipate in and occasionally facilitate relevant SCRUM events, including feature refinement, estimation, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.\\nProvide technical assistance and guidance to other engineers.\\nAbout you\\n\\nProven track record as a React Native Engineer\\nExperience with Java/Kotlin Android development.\\nExperience with Objective C/Swift iOS development.\\nExperience in deploying and delivering apps in Android and iOS.\\nFamiliarity with web development (html, css, js).\\nExperience of using WebViews to display Web applications.\\nA solid understanding of the deployment lifecycle for both Android Play Store and iOS App Store.\\nA good understanding of best practices for dealing with technical debt.\\nA good sense of best practices and what makes clean written and maintainable code.\\nAbility and desire to technically mentor other engineers.\\nStrong knowledge of Agile methodologies and software tools (we use Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence).\\nIt’d be a bonus if you:\\nExperience with hardware via USB, Bluetooth, and Ethernet.\\nPrevious implementation of push notifications and/or wallet passes.\\nExperience with React framework.\\nExperience with CI/CD pipelines for mobile app building and deployment.\\nWork perks and benefits\\nWe pride ourselves on our fantastic open, honest, inclusive culture that we have built, and continue to build. ️\\nAs a testament to this, Vita Mojo has secured a place as the UK’s Number 1 startup to work for by Tempo.\\nOur approach. We work on a hybrid model which means that once a week teams come into the office for an optional team collaboration day, and the other four days are spent working from home (or hot-desking in the office if that’s your jam!).\\nWe’re proud of the flexibility that we offer our Mojis (check us out on Flexa’s Global Top 100 companies!) and want to promote a positive work/life alignment. A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work for every Moji and team, and we encourage you to have conversations with your line manager and team to understand your work preferences and team needs.\\nThe aim is to ensure that Mojis are able to maximise their potential, build trust with their teams, establish an effective work/life alignment and also meet the needs of our growing business!\\nYour tech kit.

We have found that Mojis who thrive at Vita Mojo embrace a growth mindset and are proactive about their development, find ways to contribute and grow in non-linear (and linear!) ways. We offer a L&D allowance to support you in that development and to gain the skills, knowledge and relationships you need to soar, whether at Vita Mojo or later on in your development journey.\\nYour mental health. Through our partnership with Spill, you can ask a therapist for advice, schedule a one-off therapy session, or use a series of therapy sessions. We also offer Mental Health Days to use in moments when you need to take a day for some additional space to refocus your energies. Personal coaching is available to all Mojis through our partnership with MoreHappi, to help you grow and reach your goals!\\nYour holidays. We believe in finding your work life alignment and want you to take advantage of your 25 days of leave, plus public holidays. Your holiday allowance increases after each complete calendar year of service, up to 28 days.\\nCarer’s Leave.

We offer one week (5 days) paid leave to all Mojis.\\nWelcoming a child into your life. We have enhanced Parental leave policies! Parental leave is offered to all Mojis after 3 months at the company. Parental leave is the collective term and includes maternity, paternity, adoption leave and surrogacy. Our leave policy is meant to help you navigate through this time as successfully as possible.\\nWe recognise both the primary caregiver (the person who spends most time with the child) and the secondary (typically this is the non-birthing parent). Primary caregivers receive full pay for the first 16 weeks and 50% pay up to week 32. But need more time off? No problem, you can take up to 52 weeks (statutory) with us!\\nSecondary caregivers receive full pay for the first 4 weeks and an additional 2 weeks after 36 months of continuous service. It's up to you when you start your leave, we are here to support you through the whole process.\\n\\nYour health. We offer 10 days of full pay sick leave.\\nYour birthday. We love celebrating birthdays, whether through baked goods or gifts, and you also get the day off on (or around) your birthday every year.\\nYour social spirit. We love socialising with our fellow Mojis, whether through monthly drinks in the office, quarterly offsite socials (both virtual and in person), celebrating milestones, or anything else that comes up, we enjoy hanging out with each other!\\nDog friendly. We love our furry friends who visit the office! Calling all responsible pet owners to join us!\"},\n",
